# Decision

An assessment's own decision: block when its stored risk.block is true, otherwise its recommendation. It is not the account's decision or held-admission state.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Decision } from "@noresponse/node/models";

let value: Decision = "allow";

// Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as Unrecognized<string>
```

## Values

```typescript
"allow" | "step_up" | "review" | "block" | Unrecognized<string>
```
