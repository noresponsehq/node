# SentIdentifiers

The identifiers an assessment was sent: each member of the request's identifiers object exactly as received, before the server normalised it (the email domain keeps its case, the name its Unicode form). A member the request did not send is absent. NoResponse keeps them encrypted under the workspace's own key, does not index or log them, and deletes them with the assessment: on DELETE of the assessment or its account, at its expires_at, and with the workspace.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { SentIdentifiers } from "@noresponse/node/models";

let value: SentIdentifiers = {
  email: "New.User@Example.com",
  username: "new.user",
  phone: "+61412345678",
  name: "Alex Example",
  ip: "203.0.113.45",
};
```
