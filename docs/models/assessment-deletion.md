# AssessmentDeletion

Body of the 200 answer to DELETE /v1/assessments/{assessment_id}: one of the calling tenant's assessments was deleted, with its versions, evidence, outcomes and the identity-graph marks its outcomes set. Afterwards GET /v1/assessments/{assessment_id} answers 404 and the assessment leaves the account's history. The account is scored again from what remains: account.current_assessment_id names the assessment GET /v1/accounts/{account_id} now serves its risk from, and is absent when the account has no assessment with a decision left. Deleting an assessment that is already gone answers 404.
